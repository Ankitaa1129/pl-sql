A record is a composite datatype , which means that it can hold more than one piece of information , as compared to a scalar datatype , 
such as a number or string.

advantage of record:
1. it enables you to write code that is simple,clean,easy to maintain.

2. rather than work with long lists of variables or parameters,you can work  with a record that contains all that information.
