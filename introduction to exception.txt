an error condition during a program execution is called as exception in PL/SQL.

we can catch that errors using exception block in the program and an appropriate action is taken against the error 
condition.

there are two types of exception

1. system-define exception
2. user-define exception

declare

begin

exception

when this then
this
when this then
this
when other
then this 

end;
